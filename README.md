# x4SaveManager Overview

x4SaveManager helps to continuously backup your saves for X4 Foundations. Each backup is associated to a playthrough, which allows you to organize your backups by playthroughs. Each playthrough can have many branches which allows you to keep track of in-game decisions and the corresponding backups.

You can also have notes at the playthrough level, and at the per-backup level to easily track progress, decisions and ideas.

Easily restore any backup to an X4 Save slot to resume playback at any backup point.
